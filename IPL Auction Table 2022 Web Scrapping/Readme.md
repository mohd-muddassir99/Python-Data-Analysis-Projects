## Methodologies Used📊:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and converted data types for consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Used statistical methods and visualization tools to understand trends.
- **Summary Statistics**: Analyzed key metrics such as total sales, average order value, and customer segmentation.
- **Data Visualization**: Created bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots to reveal patterns in sales, customer demographics, and spending behavior.

## Potential Challenges🛠:
- **Data Quality Issues**: Presence of missing values and inconsistencies required thorough preprocessing.
- **Skewed Data**: Sales data might be unevenly distributed across different categories, requiring normalization.
- **Identifying Meaningful Trends**: Differentiating seasonal effects from genuine business insights.

## Key Insights 💡:
- **Top Spending Categories**: Identified product categories that contributed the most to total revenue.
- **Peak Sales Periods**: Analyzed the time periods with the highest transaction volume.
- **Customer Demographics**: Determined the most valuable customer segments based on age, gender, and location.
- **Average Spending Behavior**: Discovered variations in spending habits across different demographics.
