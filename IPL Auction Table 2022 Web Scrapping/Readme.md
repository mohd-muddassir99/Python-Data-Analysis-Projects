## Methodologies Used📊:
- **Web Scraping**: Used Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Requests to extract data from the IPL auction table.
- **Data Processing**: Cleaned and formatted the scraped data into a structured tabular format.
- **Data Storage**: Stored the extracted data in CSV or a database for further analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Performed exploratory analysis to understand team-wise spending, player prices, and auction trends.

## Potential Challenges🛠:
- **Website Structure Changes**: Dynamic updates on websites can break the scraping process.
- **Handling Dynamic Content**: Some data may be loaded dynamically via JavaScript, requiring additional techniques such as Selenium.
- **Data Cleaning**: Extracted data may contain inconsistencies, requiring preprocessing.

## Key Insights 💡:
- **Top Sold Players**: Identified the highest-paid players in the auction.
- **Team Spending Patterns**: Analyzed how different franchises allocated their budgets.
- **Player Category Trends**: Examined which player types (batsman, bowler, all-rounder) were in high demand.
- **Auction Strategy**: Observed patterns in bidding trends and price fluctuations.
